= ForemanMemcache

Adds memcache support for foreman (http://theforeman.org).

This Foreman plugin allows to use memcache as a cache storaged and session information.
this is useful when you want to deploy foreman across multiple servers and / or speed up foreman cache performance.

You would need to install memcache, currently we default to memcache installed on the same system as where foreman is running.

in later patch we would extract the settings into a configuration file.
